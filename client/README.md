## Build Setup

In order to be able to use the vuejs dev server, it is recommended to follow both the following steps and the django development server setup described in the main README.
In order to have the backend available from the vuejs dev server, a proxy like nginx could be used to pass the requests to the respective upstream.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
